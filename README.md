The purpose of the project implementation plan is to generate fake image through gan. <br />
I used BEGAN[(boundary equilibrium generative adversarial networks)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10717)<br />
There are three sample fake images produced from began.<br />

I also transfer the original Celeba data to high quality image celeba HQ as my input data.<br />
In the paper of Progressive Growing of GANs, it provides a way to get such high-resolution images.<br />
I create this data from [celeba-hq-modified](https://github.com/willylulu/celeba-hq-modified)<br />
In this task, I tried to produce different resolution image such as 64x64, 80x80, 100x100 and 112x112.<br />
